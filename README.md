# ContextRec: Contextual Sequence-Based Retrieval System using Custom BERT MLM

**ContextRec** is a contextual sequence-based retrieval system built on a custom-trained BERT-style Masked Language Model (MLM). It models user-item interaction sequences to learn contextual relationships between items, enabling personalized and intelligent retrieval and recommendations.

Unlike traditional recommender systems that rely on static co-occurrence or collaborative filtering, ContextRec uses deep sequence modeling to understand behavior in context—much like how language models interpret word sequences.

## Overview

ContextRec treats item interaction sequences as "sentences" and learns to predict masked items based on their surrounding context. This approach captures both short-term and long-term dependencies in user behavior, making it well-suited for personalized retrieval tasks.

---

## What This System Does

- Learns contextual item embeddings from sequential interaction data
- Models session-level behavior using transformer-based MLM
- Predicts masked items, enabling intelligent item retrieval
- Supports real-time recommendations by understanding a user's current session

## Why Context-Based Sequence Modeling?

### Contextual Awareness
Item meaning is highly contextual. The same item may mean different things depending on what comes before or after it in a session.

### Temporal & Sequential Modeling
Users follow behavioral patterns. Modeling those sequences allows the system to predict and retrieve items based on session progression.

### Generalization & Flexibility
ContextRec doesn't just memorize co-occurrence—it learns item relationships in context, making it more generalizable across domains.

## How It Works

- **Custom Vocabulary**: Built from unique product/item IDs with required special tokens (`[PAD]`, `[MASK]`, `[SEP]`, etc.).
- **Tokenizer**: `BertTokenizerFast` tokenizes sequences of item IDs.
- **Model**: `BertForMaskedLM` is trained from scratch with a config that matches the custom vocab.
- **Objective**: Masked Language Modeling (MLM), where items in a sequence are randomly masked and predicted based on context.

## Applications

ContextRec can be integrated into various stages of the user journey:

- **Search Re-ranking**: Reorder search results based on session context
- **Item Detail Page (IDP)**: Suggest complementary or similar items while viewing a product
- **Cart Recommendations**: Show relevant add-ons or bundles
- **Pre-Checkout**: Surface high-converting cross-sell items
- **Post-Checkout**: Recommend next-best actions or repeat purchases

---

## Extensibility

The current implementation uses **only product IDs** to build sequences and train the model. However, this architecture is extensible. We can enhance it by incorporating:

- Product category or brand embeddings
- User demographics or behavior segments
- Temporal features (e.g., time of day, day of week)
- Event types (view, cart, purchase)

By including these contextual signals, the model can learn richer relationships and deliver even more accurate and personalized recommendations.
